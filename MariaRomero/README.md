#FS and Async, April 7, 2016

##Description:
This assignment reads three text files and console
logs the first 8 bytes in hex of each file.
The three files are read and console logged in the
order `'one.txt', 'two.txt', 'three.txt'` regardless of file size.

One test has been implemented to ensure files are read and console logged in the
correct order.
