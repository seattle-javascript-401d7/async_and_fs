##Description:
For this assignment you will need to read three files and console 
log the first 8 bytes in hex of each file.
Also, you must guarantee that three files are read and console logged in the 
order `'one.txt', 'two.txt', 'three.txt'` regardless of file size. 

You can use any method of handling async except nested callback. For a bonus
point don't use event emitters either. 

You will also need to look up and implement async testing, making sure that
you are not getting "false positives"(tests that are passing but shouldn't be).

##Rubric:
  * Async Handling: 4pts
  * Use of fs: 2pts
  * Testing: 4pts
