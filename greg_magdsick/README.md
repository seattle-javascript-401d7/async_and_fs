This script is based off of code shown in the CodeFellows 401d7 course on April 6th, 2016, as well as from discussion with Phillip Nguyen

This code grabs data asynchrounously from three text files and then outputs the first 8 bits in hex of each file, in order.

To execute this code, from the base directory, run "node lib/async.js"
