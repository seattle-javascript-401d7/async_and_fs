# Async and fs Assignment
A simple file parser was created that prints to the console the first 8 bytes (utf-8 and hex) of each of the three provided text files. The parser outputs the truncated contents of `one.txt`, `two.txt`, and `three.txt` in that order, regardless of the file size.

After installing with `npm install`, you may run the app with `node index` or `bin/async`. Tests may be viewed with `gulp` or `gulp test`.
