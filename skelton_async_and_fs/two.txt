Let's put some happy trees and bushes back in here. This is your world, whatever makes you happy you can put in it. Go crazy. A little happy sunlight shining through there. If we're gonna walk though the woods, we need a little path.

Don't forget to tell these special people in your life just how special they are to you. Just let your mind wander and enjoy. This should make you happy. We don't want to set these clouds on fire.

There we go. Let's do it again then, what the heck. You can do anything here. So don't worry about it. Put light against light - you have nothing. Put dark against dark - you have nothing. It's the contrast of light and dark that each give the other one meaning. This is the fun part

Fluff that up. All kinds of happy little splashes. Only God can make a tree - but you can paint one. Making all those little fluffies that live in the clouds. I will take some magic white, and a little bit of Vandyke brown and a little touch of yellow. We start with a vision in our heart, and we put it on canvas.

Every time you practice, you learn more. Don't fight it, use what happens. Everybody needs a friend.

Van Dyke Brown is a very nice brown, it's almost like a chocolate brown. Maybe he has a little friend that lives right over here. And that's when it becomes fun - you don't have to spend your time thinking about what's happening - you just let it happen.

Poor old tree. We don't have to be concerned about it. We just have to let it fall where it will. Steve wants reflections, so let's give him reflections.

Let's do that again. It's a super day, so why not make a beautiful sky? We'll have a super time. Isn't that fantastic? We spend so much of our life looking - but never seeing.

Trees grow in all kinds of ways. They're not all perfectly straight. Not every limb is perfect. I'll go over the colors one more time that we use: Titanium white, Thalo green, Prussian blue, Van Dyke brown, Alizarin crimson, Sap green, Cad yellow, and Permanent red. This is unplanned it really just happens. Talk to trees, look at the birds. Whatever it takes. If you don't like it - change it. It's your world.

Volunteering your time; it pays you and your whole community fantastic dividends. Maybe there's a little something happening right here. With practice comes confidence. But we're not there yet, so we don't need to worry about it. Didn't you know you had that much power? You can move mountains. You can do anything.

This is an example of what you can do with just a few things, a little imagination and a happy dream in your heart. We'll put all the little clouds in and let them dance around and have fun. If you hypnotize it, it will go away. The more we do this - the more it will do good things to our heart. Let's build an almighty mountain. If you overwork it you become a cloud killer. There's nothing worse than a cloud killer.

We don't have anything but happy trees here. Don't hurry. Take your time and enjoy. Let's put a touch more of the magic here. Use what you see, don't plan it. You have to allow the paint to break to make it beautiful.

Just take out whatever you don't want. It'll change your entire perspective. We don't have to be committed. We are just playing here. Let's have a little bit of fun today. What the devil. You better get your coat out, this is going to be a cold painting. Nature is so fantastic, enjoy it. Let it make you happy.

Exercising the imagination, experimenting with talents, being creative; these things, to me, are truly the windows to your soul. Even trees need a friend. We all need friends. I want everbody to be happy. That's what it's all about. Be careful. You can always add more - but you can't take it away. Now we'll take the almighty fan brush.

Let's make some happy little clouds in our world. Think about a cloud. Just float around and be there. Just relax and let it flow. That easy. Just beat the devil out of it.

But they're very easily killed. Clouds are delicate. If I paint something, I don't want to have to explain what it is. See how easy it is to create a little tree right in your world. You can work and carry-on and put lots of little happy things in here. We'll lay all these little funky little things in there.

You can create anything that makes you happy. We're trying to teach you a technique here and how to use it. In your world you have total and absolute power.

I'm going to mix up a little color. Weâ€™ll use Van Dyke Brown, Permanent Red, and a little bit of Prussian Blue. No pressure. Just relax and watch it happen. Go out on a limb - that's where the fruit is. Now we don't want him to get lonely, so we'll give him a little friend. Now we can begin working on lots of happy little things.

This is truly an almighty mountain. We'll paint one happy little tree right here. It's beautiful - and we haven't even done anything to it yet. Paint anything you want on the canvas. Create your own world. The only prerequisite is that it makes you happy. If it makes you happy then it's good.

We'll make some happy little bushes here. Let's put some happy little bushes on the other side now. Painting should do one thing. It should put happiness in your heart. Nice little fluffy clouds laying around in the sky being lazy. You can do it. In life you need colors.

The light is your friend. Preserve it. The secret to doing anything is believing that you can do it. Anything that you believe you can do strong enough, you can do. Anything. As long as you believe. We don't make mistakes we just have happy little accidents. In nature, dead trees are just as normal as live trees. How to paint. That's easy. What to paint. That's much harder. We artists are a different breed of people. We're a happy bunch.

This is your world. Be so very light. Be a gentle whisper. Don't fiddle with it all day. Only think about one thing at a time. Don't get greedy.

It's important to me that you're happy. Just pretend you are a whisper floating across a mountain. You don't have to spend all your time thinking about what you're doing, you just let it happen.

This is the way you take out your flustrations. Put it in, leave it alone. Just make little strokes like that. Little trees and bushes grow however makes them happy. That's what painting is all about. It should make you feel good when you paint. If you've been in Alaska less than a year you're a Cheechako.

Everybody's different. Trees are different. Let them all be individuals. There's not a thing in the world wrong with washing your brush. The only thing worse than yellow snow is green snow.

You can do anything here - the only pre-requisite is that it makes you happy. Remember how free clouds are. They just lay around in the sky all day long. We'll take a little bit of Van Dyke Brown. A tree needs to be your friend if you're going to paint him. If you don't think every day is a good day - try missing a few. You'll see.

This is the time to get out all your flustrations, much better than kicking the dog around the house or taking it out on your spouse. You got your heavy coat out yet? It's getting colder. In this world, everything can be happy.

Let's put some happy trees and bushes back in here. This is your world, whatever makes you happy you can put in it. Go crazy. A little happy sunlight shining through there. If we're gonna walk though the woods, we need a little path.

I want everbody to be happy. That's what it's all about. Be careful. You can always add more - but you can't take it away. Now we'll take the almighty fan brush.

Let's make some happy little clouds in our world. Think about a cloud. Just float around and be there. Just relax and let it flow. That easy. Just beat the devil out of it.

But they're very easily killed. Clouds are delicate. If I paint something, I don't want to have to explain what it is. See how easy it is to create a little tree right in your world. You can work and carry-on and put lots of little happy things in here. We'll lay all these little funky little things in there.

You can create anything that makes you happy. We're trying to teach you a technique here and how to use it. In your world you have total and absolute power.

I'm going to mix up a little color. Weâ€™ll use Van Dyke Brown, Permanent Red, and a little bit of Prussian Blue. No pressure. Just relax and watch it happen. Go out on a limb - that's where the fruit is. Now we don't want him to get lonely, so we'll give him a little friend. Now we can begin working on lots of happy little things.

This is truly an almighty mountain. We'll paint one happy little tree right here. It's beautiful - and we haven't even done anything to it yet. Paint anything you want on the canvas. Create your own world. The only prerequisite is that it makes you happy. If it makes you happy then it's good.

We'll make some happy little bushes here. Let's put some happy little bushes on the other side now. Painting should do one thing. It should put happiness in your heart. Nice little fluffy clouds laying around in the sky being lazy. You can do it. In life you need colors.

The light is your friend. Preserve it. The secret to doing anything is believing that you can do it. Anything that you believe you can do strong enough, you can do. Anything. As long as you believe. We don't make mistakes we just have happy little accidents. In nature, dead trees are just as normal as live trees. How to paint. That's easy. What to paint. That's much harder. We artists are a different breed of people. We're a happy bunch.

This is your world. Be so very light. Be a gentle whisper. Don't fiddle with it all day. Only think about one thing at a time. Don't get greedy.

It's important to me that you're happy. Just pretend you are a whisper floating across a mountain. You don't have to spend all your time thinking about what you're doing, you just let it happen.

This is the way you take out your flustrations. Put it in, leave it alone. Just make little strokes like that. Little trees and bushes grow however makes them happy. That's what painting is all about. It should make you feel good when you paint. If you've been in Alaska less than a year you're a Cheechako.

Everybody's different. Trees are different. Let them all be individuals. There's not a thing in the world wrong with washing your brush. The only thing worse than yellow snow is green snow.

You can do anything here - the only pre-requisite is that it makes you happy. Remember how free clouds are. They just lay around in the sky all day long. We'll take a little bit of Van Dyke Brown. A tree needs to be your friend if you're going to paint him. If you don't think every day is a good day - try missing a few. You'll see.

This is the time to get out all your flustrations, much better than kicking the dog around the house or taking it out on your spouse. You got your heavy coat out yet? It's getting colder. In this world, everything can be happy.Let's put some happy trees and bushes back in here. This is your world, whatever makes you happy you can put in it. Go crazy. A little happy sunlight shining through there. If we're gonna walk though the woods, we need a little path.

Don't forget to tell these special people in your life just how special they are to you. Just let your mind wander and enjoy. This should make you happy. We don't want to set these clouds on fire.

There we go. Let's do it again then, what the heck. You can do anything here. So don't worry about it. Put light against light - you have nothing. Put dark against dark - you have nothing. It's the contrast of light and dark that each give the other one meaning. This is the fun part

Fluff that up. All kinds of happy little splashes. Only God can make a tree - but you can paint one. Making all those little fluffies that live in the clouds. I will take some magic white, and a little bit of Vandyke brown and a little touch of yellow. We start with a vision in our heart, and we put it on canvas.

Every time you practice, you learn more. Don't fight it, use what happens. Everybody needs a friend.

Van Dyke Brown is a very nice brown, it's almost like a chocolate brown. Maybe he has a little friend that lives right over here. And that's when it becomes fun - you don't have to spend your time thinking about what's happening - you just let it happen.

Poor old tree. We don't have to be concerned about it. We just have to let it fall where it will. Steve wants reflections, so let's give him reflections.

Let's do that again. It's a super day, so why not make a beautiful sky? We'll have a super time. Isn't that fantastic? We spend so much of our life looking - but never seeing.

Trees grow in all kinds of ways. They're not all perfectly straight. Not every limb is perfect. I'll go over the colors one more time that we use: Titanium white, Thalo green, Prussian blue, Van Dyke brown, Alizarin crimson, Sap green, Cad yellow, and Permanent red. This is unplanned it really just happens. Talk to trees, look at the birds. Whatever it takes. If you don't like it - change it. It's your world.

Volunteering your time; it pays you and your whole community fantastic dividends. Maybe there's a little something happening right here. With practice comes confidence. But we're not there yet, so we don't need to worry about it. Didn't you know you had that much power? You can move mountains. You can do anything.

This is an example of what you can do with just a few things, a little imagination and a happy dream in your heart. We'll put all the little clouds in and let them dance around and have fun. If you hypnotize it, it will go away. The more we do this - the more it will do good things to our heart. Let's build an almighty mountain. If you overwork it you become a cloud killer. There's nothing worse than a cloud killer.

We don't have anything but happy trees here. Don't hurry. Take your time and enjoy. Let's put a touch more of the magic here. Use what you see, don't plan it. You have to allow the paint to break to make it beautiful.

Just take out whatever you don't want. It'll change your entire perspective. We don't have to be committed. We are just playing here. Let's have a little bit of fun today. What the devil. You better get your coat out, this is going to be a cold painting. Nature is so fantastic, enjoy it. Let it make you happy.

This is the time to get out all your flustrations, much better than kicking the dog around the house or taking it out on your spouse. You got your heavy coat out yet? It's getting colder. In this world, everything can be happy.Let's put some happy trees and bushes back in here. This is your world, whatever makes you happy you can put in it. Go crazy. A little happy sunlight shining through there. If we're gonna walk though the woods, we need a little path.

Don't forget to tell these special people in your life just how special they are to you. Just let your mind wander and enjoy. This should make you happy. We don't want to set these clouds on fire.

There we go. Let's do it again then, what the heck. You can do anything here. So don't worry about it. Put light against light - you have nothing. Put dark against dark - you have nothing. It's the contrast of light and dark that each give the other one meaning. This is the fun part

Fluff that up. All kinds of happy little splashes. Only God can make a tree - but you can paint one. Making all those little fluffies that live in the clouds. I will take some magic white, and a little bit of Vandyke brown and a little touch of yellow. We start with a vision in our heart, and we put it on canvas.

Every time you practice, you learn more. Don't fight it, use what happens. Everybody needs a friend.

Van Dyke Brown is a very nice brown, it's almost like a chocolate brown. Maybe he has a little friend that lives right over here. And that's when it becomes fun - you don't have to spend your time thinking about what's happening - you just let it happen.

Poor old tree. We don't have to be concerned about it. We just have to let it fall where it will. Steve wants reflections, so let's give him reflections.

Let's do that again. It's a super day, so why not make a beautiful sky? We'll have a super time. Isn't that fantastic? We spend so much of our life looking - but never seeing.

Trees grow in all kinds of ways. They're not all perfectly straight. Not every limb is perfect. I'll go over the colors one more time that we use: Titanium white, Thalo green, Prussian blue, Van Dyke brown, Alizarin crimson, Sap green, Cad yellow, and Permanent red. This is unplanned it really just happens. Talk to trees, look at the birds. Whatever it takes. If you don't like it - change it. It's your world.

Volunteering your time; it pays you and your whole community fantastic dividends. Maybe there's a little something happening right here. With practice comes confidence. But we're not there yet, so we don't need to worry about it. Didn't you know you had that much power? You can move mountains. You can do anything.

This is an example of what you can do with just a few things, a little imagination and a happy dream in your heart. We'll put all the little clouds in and let them dance around and have fun. If you hypnotize it, it will go away. The more we do this - the more it will do good things to our heart. Let's build an almighty mountain. If you overwork it you become a cloud killer. There's nothing worse than a cloud killer.

We don't have anything but happy trees here. Don't hurry. Take your time and enjoy. Let's put a touch more of the magic here. Use what you see, don't plan it. You have to allow the paint to break to make it beautiful.

Just take out whatever you don't want. It'll change your entire perspective. We don't have to be committed. We are just playing here. Let's have a little bit of fun today. What the devil. You better get your coat out, this is going to be a cold painting. Nature is so fantastic, enjoy it. Let it make you happy.

Exercising the imagination, experimenting with talents, being creative; these things, to me, are truly the windows to your soul. Even trees need a friend. We all need friends. I want everbody to be happy. That's what it's all about. Be careful. You can always add more - but you can't take it away. Now we'll take the almighty fan brush.

Let's make some happy little clouds in our world. Think about a cloud. Just float around and be there. Just relax and let it flow. That easy. Just beat the devil out of it.

But they're very easily killed. Clouds are delicate. If I paint something, I don't want to have to explain what it is. See how easy it is to create a little tree right in your world. You can work and carry-on and put lots of little happy things in here. We'll lay all these little funky little things in there.

You can create anything that makes you happy. We're trying to teach you a technique here and how to use it. In your world you have total and absolute power.

I'm going to mix up a little color. Weâ€™ll use Van Dyke Brown, Permanent Red, and a little bit of Prussian Blue. No pressure. Just relax and watch it happen. Go out on a limb - that's where the fruit is. Now we don't want him to get lonely, so we'll give him a little friend. Now we can begin working on lots of happy little things.

This is truly an almighty mountain. We'll paint one happy little tree right here. It's beautiful - and we haven't even done anything to it yet. Paint anything you want on the canvas. Create your own world. The only prerequisite is that it makes you happy. If it makes you happy then it's good.

We'll make some happy little bushes here. Let's put some happy little bushes on the other side now. Painting should do one thing. It should put happiness in your heart. Nice little fluffy clouds laying around in the sky being lazy. You can do it. In life you need colors.

The light is your friend. Preserve it. The secret to doing anything is believing that you can do it. Anything that you believe you can do strong enough, you can do. Anything. As long as you believe. We don't make mistakes we just have happy little accidents. In nature, dead trees are just as normal as live trees. How to paint. That's easy. What to paint. That's much harder. We artists are a different breed of people. We're a happy bunch.

This is your world. Be so very light. Be a gentle whisper. Don't fiddle with it all day. Only think about one thing at a time. Don't get greedy.

It's important to me that you're happy. Just pretend you are a whisper floating across a mountain. You don't have to spend all your time thinking about what you're doing, you just let it happen.

This is the way you take out your flustrations. Put it in, leave it alone. Just make little strokes like that. Little trees and bushes grow however makes them happy. That's what painting is all about. It should make you feel good when you paint. If you've been in Alaska less than a year you're a Cheechako.

Everybody's different. Trees are different. Let them all be individuals. There's not a thing in the world wrong with washing your brush. The only thing worse than yellow snow is green snow.
